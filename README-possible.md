# Ready Salted: The Game
*Prepare to get salty!*

*Ready Salted* is a 3D game for Android and iOS, for crisp lovers 
everywhere.


## Gameplay
In Ready Salted, you play as a plucky little bag of crisps, just trying to 
get some flavour & recognition from the Hungry Humans that come to eat you. 
The aim of the game is to catch the correct ingredients for your flavour of 
crisp, but be careful! Ingredients of the wrong flavour are also falling, 
and the Hungry Humans will not appreciate a bag of the wrong kind of crisps!

You have 5 crisps in your bag (you are a “fun size” packet). As ingredients 
fall, swipe up/down/left/right to move yourself under those ingredients! Try 
to catch ones that match your bag’s flavour, matched as follows:

- Ready Salted - A Salt Shaker
- Cheese & Onion- A Chunk of Mature Swiss Cheese
- Prawn Cocktail - A Prawn
- Roast Chicken - A Whole Chicken
- Smoky Bacon - A Rasher of Bacon
- Salt & Vinegar - A Bottle Of Vinegar

As you catch ingredients, your crisps will get flavoured, which is shown on 
the bar on the bottom right. Caught ingredients of the right type are 
highlighted in green, incorrect ones in red. At random, a Hungry Human will 
reach down to get a bag of crisps. This is your moment. Get yourself beneath 
the hand in time and you’ll get points, but be careful! You only get points 
for the crisps that have the flavour that matches your bag! Once your crisps 
have been eaten, you go on the search again. Then the cycle continues, 
forever, or until the timer stops, whichever is sooner.
